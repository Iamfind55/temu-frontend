                           The security of your personal information is important to us. We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We also follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (&quot;PCI-DSS&quot;) in handling your credit card information. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies.

                           We generally retain personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, as well as for the purposes of satisfying any applicable U.S. legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable U.S. legal requirements.
